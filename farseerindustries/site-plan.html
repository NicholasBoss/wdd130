      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Ever want to display all you hard work in one place for employers to see? My website will display all the accomplishments I have done in my time here at BYU-Idaho, and it can be applicable to any who want to display their own work on their own website. This website will become a template for any to use with little to no instructions on how to build it. Using this website will reduce the amount of paper you use and you can bring a mobile device (preferrably a tablet) to any interview to show off your accomplishments.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This site is focused toward any who want to make an aesthetically pleasing site to show off their accomplishments. Whether it is for a school project or a business interview, this site is just for you. This is also for employers who are looking for ways to suggest a helpful format they may want to see in an interview. The site can be used as is (and updated accordingly) for each individual who wants to store their accomplishments for anyone to see.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->
